# Hilt. Basis

For ease of use, I added TODO filter. To follow links you need to create filters - click to `TODO`
in bottom panel -> icon
filter ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121166010/214673108-b36497d7-85a4-4086-8beb-c6e8dbe297ad.png)
-> Edit Filters -> add pattern `\bdagger\b.*` and filter `dagger`

## Module
* AppComponent has access to Application
```kotlin
@Module
// list of components - SingletonComponent - it AppComponent generated by hilt
@InstallIn(SingletonComponent::class)
class StoreModule {

    @Provides
    fun provideDatabaseHelper(app: Application): DatabaseHelper {
        return DatabaseHelper(app)
    }
}
```
* ActivityComponent has access to Application and Activity
```kotlin
@Module
// list of components - ActivityComponent - it component for all activities, generated by hilt
@InstallIn(ActivityComponent::class)
class NetworkModule {

    // In this example AppComponent doesn't know about this object
    @Provides
    fun provideNetworkUtils(app: Application, activity: Activity): NetworkUtils {
        return NetworkUtils(app, activity)
    }
}
```

* FragmentComponent has access to Application and Activity and Fragment
```kotlin
@Module
// list of components - FragmentComponent - it component for all fragments, generated by hilt
@InstallIn(FragmentComponent::class)
class NetworkModule {

    // In this example AppComponent doesn't know about this object
    @Provides
    fun provideNetworkUtils(app: Application, activity: Activity, fragment: Fragment): NetworkUtils {
        return NetworkUtils(app, activity)
    }
